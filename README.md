Gopi’s Restaurant
This is my first simple restaurant website, built to learn and practice basic web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The site includes a welcoming homepage, information about the restaurant, a menu with popular dishes (with images, names, descriptions, and prices), category filters to quickly browse (Veg, Non-Veg, Dessert), and an easy-to-use search bar. There’s also a contact section with hours and location details.

I made this project by starting with some code from ChatGPT, then added my own dish images, menu content, logo, and descriptions to customize it. The design works on both computers and mobile devices, and you can explore the menu by using the search or choosing different filters.

What I used
HTML to build the structure and sections
CSS for the design and layout
JavaScript for search and menu filtering

How to use
Download or clone the repository.
Open the index.html file in your browser.

What I learned
This project helped me understand how websites work and how to make them interactive. I learned how to organize files, link styles and scripts, and create features that respond to user input.

Next steps
I’d like to improve this site by adding features like a cart for online orders, allowing users to leave reviews, and maybe connecting it to a database in the future.
